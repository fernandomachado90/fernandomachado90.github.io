Hello, world!

I've been working as a full-stack software developer for around a decade. I am very fluent in agile development practices and love to discover clever ways of using technology to create products that solve real problems.

I believe in open communication, inter-role collaboration, continuous learning and diversity in workplaces.

Feel free to reach me anywhere :)
