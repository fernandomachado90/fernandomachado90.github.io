Hello, world!

I've been working as a **full stack software developer** for around a decade.
I'm very fluent in **agile development** practices
and love to discover clever ways of using technology
to create that can solve real problems.

In my experience, I believe that authentic **communication**,
interdisciplinary **collaboration**, autonomy to seek excellency
and **continuous experimenting, learning and improving** are the keys
to a successful project.

Over the last few years, I've been heavily involved in **education** projects
that shared a goal of making the IT industry more diverse.
From **teaching** programming logic to teenagers to **mentoring** junior development
teams about agile practices, the **social** projects I was involved in with
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/aceleradora) have benefited
dozens of people and helped pave the way for the first steps of some of them
into the industry.

On my free time, I really enjoy being in the nature, riding bikes, swimming,
listening to [a wild variety of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/fernandomachado90)
and playing videogames (Switch friend code: `4419-5091-4908`).

During the quarentine, I've discovered a new hobby of
putting **messages in bottles** and tossing them into the
seas of [GitHub](https://github.com/fernandomachado90)
and [Medium](https://medium.com/@fernandomachado90)
in hopes they'll be useful to someone.

For instance, if you wish to create your own personal page like this one,
choosing your own theme and layout,
please use this [template](https://github.com/fernandomachado90/hugo.github.io-maker).
I'd be really happy to see the results!

Feel free to reach me anywhere :)
