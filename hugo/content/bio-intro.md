## Hello, world!

I've been working as a **full stack software developer** for around a decade.
I'm very fluent in **agile development** practices
and love to discover new ways of using technology
to craft products - big or small - that can **solve real problems**.

In my experience, I believe that authentic **communication**,
interdisciplinary **collaboration**, autonomy to seek excellency
and **continuous experimenting, learning and improving** are the keys
to a successful project.
