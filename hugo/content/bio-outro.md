Over the last few years, I've been heavily involved in **education** projects
that shared a goal of making the IT industry more **inclusive**.
From **designing** the coursework vision,
to **teaching** programming logic to teenagers,
to **mentoring** junior development teams about agile practices,
the **social** projects I helped create with
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/aceleradora) have benefited
dozens of people, paved the way for the first steps of some of them
into the industry and made me discover a new **vocation**.

On my free time, I really enjoy being in the nature, riding a bike, swimming,
listening to a [wild variety of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/fernandomachado90)
and playing videogames (Switch friend code: `4419-5091-4908`).

More recently, I've also discovered a hobby of
putting **messages in bottles** and tossing them into the
vast seas of [GitHub](https://github.com/fernandomachado90)
and [Medium](https://medium.com/@fernandomachado90)
hoping they'll eventually reach someone and be useful to the community.

For instance, if you wish to create your own personal page like this one,
but choosing your own custom theme and layout,
please use this [template](https://github.com/fernandomachado90/hugo.github.io-maker).
I'd be really happy to see the results!

Feel free to reach me anywhere :)
