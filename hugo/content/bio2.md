Over the last few years, I've been deeply involved in educational projects
that shared a goal of making the IT industry more **diverse and inclusive**.
From **teaching** the basics of programming logic to **mentoring**
junior development teams on agile practices,
the social projects I helped **build and run** at
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/aceleradora) have touched
dozens of students, paved the way for the first steps of some of them
into the industry and made me discover a new **vocation**.

On my free time, I really enjoy being in the nature, riding a bike,
swimming in and outdoors,
listening to a [wild variety of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/fernandomachado90)
and playing videogames (nintendo switch: `4419-5091-4908`).
