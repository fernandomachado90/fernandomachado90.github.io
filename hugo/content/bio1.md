Hello, world!

My name is **Fernando Machado**. I was born in 1990 and
I currently live in [São José dos Campos](https://goo.gl/maps/CqN2bSJMgxhejLE58), São Paulo, Brasil.

I've been working as a **full stack software developer** for around a decade.
I'm very fluent in **agile development** practices
and love to learn new ways of applying technology
to craft stuff that can **solve real problems**.

I believe that authentic **communication**,
interdisciplinary **collaboration**, autonomy to seek excellency
and **continuous experimenting, learning and improving** are the keys
to the success of a team, a project or an entire company.
