Over the last few years, I've been deeply involved in educational projects
that shared a goal of making the IT industry more **diverse and inclusive**.
From **teaching** the basics of programming logic to **mentoring**
junior development teams on agile practices,
the social projects I helped build and run at
[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/aceleradora) have touched
dozens of students, paved the way for the first steps of some of them
into the industry and made me discover a new **vocation**.
